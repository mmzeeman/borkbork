# Bork bork bork!

Swedish chef inspired experiment room.

The chef is now busy with generating Drakon diagrams from text files.

A text description like: 

```
drakon (* Good day *) primitive {
    action (* Eat breakfast *)
    action (* Eat lunch *)
    action (* Eat dinner *)
} end
```

Will be transformed into an easy to understand Drakon diagram.

## What is Drakon?

Drakon is an algorithmic visual programming language developed within the Buran space project. During the 
development of the russian space shuttle, the Buran, the engineers needed to solve an important problem.
The rocket engineers needed to communicate effectively with aerodynamic, software, and a lot of other engineers.
They lacked a language which they could use to talk to each other and understand each others problems. To solve 
this problem Drakon was developed in a unique collaboration between cognitive psychologists, language experts and
methematicians. They kept the visual language strict and easy to understand.

## Why make a text representation of visual drakon diagrams?

Visual diagrams are very nice because you can see the structures.

 * You can only use one arm and 1 finger to draw. It is faster to use 10 fingers.
 * Storing the diagram in text format allows one to use common utilities.
 * Possible to put under source control.
